main bhool jaoon tumhen ab yahee 
munaasib hai magar bhulaana 
bhee chaahoon to kis tarah bhooloon 
ki tum to phir bhee haqeeqat ho 
koee khvaab nahin yahaan to 
dil ka ye aalam hai kya kahoon kamabakht! bhula na paaya ye vo silasila jo tha hee nahin
Vo ik khayaal jo aavaaz tak gaya hee nahin 
vo ek baat jo main kah nahin saka tumase 
vo ek rabt jo hamamen kabhee raha hee nahin mujhe hai yaad vo sab jo kabhee hua hee nahin

Yu choti-choti baat par haste hai wo
Fir bhi udass sa lagta hai wo
Shyad kaiyo ke dilo Mai Basta hai wo 
Fir bhi akela akela sa lagt hai wo
Kaiyeo ke liye Sahara hai 
Lekin khuda aashiq banjara hai
Kaiyo ko hasta hai 
Lekin Fir bhi khudhi ko rulata hai...
Aakhir kyu udass yadoon 
Mai kho sa jaata hai..
Ye dil ek banjara hai
khudi ke boj se mara hai

Chali gayi ho chhod kar mujhe, 
Magar aaj bhi mere pass ho tum,
Meri is aam si zindagi mein,
Aaj bhi sabse khaas ho tum,
Baatein ab hoti nahi humaari,
Maan leta hun mujhse naraaz ho tum,
Moaan ho gya hun tumhare jaane ke baad,
Magar Aaj bhi mere dil ki awaaz ho tum,

My darling,
I have met the ocean at my feet
I have kissed the sunâ€™s rays at the close of day
I have had misfortune, fortune dress my path.
I have seeked, found, lost and bestowed.
But never have I yearned to quench 
a thirst that only your absence can deny.
Find my heart within the realms of your existence,
because within my thoughts it's so painfully out of reach.

Betaab thi mohabbat ke liye
magar pyaar na kar saki
Use thi mujhse mohabbat magar
izhaar na kar saki
Us pagli se jab bhi pucha
mujhse mohabbat hai
Mana to karti thi magar
thik se inqaar na kar saki

I heard of you in the wind last night,
it was a subtle laugh that called me from
a memory from our first encounter.
What I wouldn't do to just find you 
in that moment and not just in my memory.

<|startofpoem|>
I choose to love you in silence, 
For in silence I find no rejection.
I choose to love you in loneliness, 
For in loneliness no one owns you but me.
I choose you adore you from a distance, 
For distance will shield me from pain.
I choose to kiss you in the wind, 
For the wind is gentler than my lips.

Har ashiq ki ek ajab kahani hai, 
Chup rehna bhi pyaar ki nishani hai, 
Koizakhm nahi phir bhi dard ka ehsas hai,
Lagta hai dil ka ek tukda aaj bhi uske paas hai..!

Inn kaaton ki duniya mein,
Mere baalon mein phool lagaoge?
Gumraah yahan sab karte hain
Mera raasta ban paoge?
Safar bada hi lamba hai,
Itni duur saath chal paoge?

Galib ki gazal sun ke 
Har koi gale laga le ta hai
Jise suna ne keliy 
Likhi thi gazal
Vo hi sunke nazr hata leta hai

Galib ke dil ka ras ta band Nazr ata hai
Jabse gayi premika chod ke
Koi bhi aye aur kaht khataye 
Gali to roz muth mar ke soja ta hai.

Lakdio ke bal jitne strong hona zaruri hai
Utna hi ladko ke liye bhi kyu jab me 
Bal pad ke maruga or bal hath ne aagye to maza nhi aye ga

tumhen phurasat mil jaaye 
to mujhase baat karana
jab sab se dil bhar jaaye

mera to farz banata hai 
intazaar karana 
tum paaband nahin
tum jis se chaaho us

Ye dil hi tha jo sehe gaya 
Vo bat aisi kehe gaya
Kehene ko fir kya rehe gaya
Askho ka dariya behe gaya
Ab gam uthe kiskeliy

Yu ja gavae kiskeliye
Jab kehe ne vo dilbar gaya ki me tere liye mar gaya rote he usko rat bhar me aur meri ava re gi
Me aur meri avaragi

Kit ne sare saval hai
Bas ek hai javab
Na ati tum zindgi me 
Na paida hota koi khab 

Na me behek tak rasto se
Jo hoti meri mazil ka chehera tum
Mazil itni bha gayi thi
Ke raste ki khai dikhai na di

Kaise jadu tha teri yado me
Muje beka bu kardiya
Na mazil ka na rahe 
Teri lehera ti zulpho ka
Andh musafir kar diya...

Kya faida aise manzil ka 
Jis ki rah me tumhare 
pyar ka shehre na ho

Kya faida aise manzil ka
Jis ki rah ke musafir
tum na ho

Kya faida aise manzil ka
Jis ki rah pe tum muj se
ghuf tu gu  na karo

Kabhi kabhi man me ek khayal ata hai 
Chod gayi tu kaise jiye ge ham
Tere bina jeene me bhi kya koi saar hai
Tu nhi sath mera to jena dushvar hai
Tere liye kuch kar saku aisa mera naseeb kaha
Ek aur bar teri dat su ne kon bekar hu
Magar mere nasseb me vo bat kaha

Ohh my dear love 
I speak to you with my open heart
Shattered into pieces again and again 
With act of betrayal and often growing apart
The heart that you stitched 
With strings of love and memories 
made me feel that once
Once Again i could live like my favourite duck 
My body may deteriorate
My spirit may fade away 
But my love for you is 
eternal only that i could say

Kashti zindgi ki thi ek din dub hi janhi thi
Teri ankho me dube vo ek haseen lamha tha
Teri bato me khoe vo ek hasee. Lamha tha
Par tere sath waqt guzar tab samaja
Ham sardi aur garmi ki tara hai ek pas aye to dusra vaqt ke sath chal hi jata hai

Par hamere liye bhib khud becch me 
ek haseen pal dala hai 
aur bas me har guzar te waqt ke sath 
us pal me tujse aitabar kar ne ka intazar kar ta hu
 Apni har shayri tere naa. Kar ta hu
Aur kya kahu

It would be better 
If we were together 
I was lost in hope
And you lost hope in me
But i guess it was destiny 
That Told me 
To be me
And finally i hope you find hope in me

It would be better, a whisper that stings,
If we were together, two intertwined wings.
I clung to a dream, with hope as my guide,
While yours, like a bird, from my fingers did slide.

But whispers of fate, they carried a plea,
"Embrace what you are, the truest you be."
So here I stand, though tears sometimes fall,
A heart that is Shattered, yet ready for all
<|endofpoem|>

The world may move on, but a part of me clings,
To the laughter we shared, the joy that love brings.
A broken melody, a love's fading light,
But even in darkness, my love like a star shines so bright.
<|endofpoem|>

<|startofpoem|>
We built sandcastles on the shore, destined for the tide,
But the laughter we shared, forever will reside.

Though the future's a canvas, painted in shades of gray,
The love we once held, will never fade away.

So I'll raise a glass, a toast to what once was,
A bittersweet memory, a bittersweet cause.

For even in darkness, a star can still gleam,
And a broken heart, can still hold a dream.
<|endofpoem|>

<|startofpoem|>
I thought it will be death
that will rip us apart 
But my love your words did the part...
I still call you love 
Cause you never fade
Even in the darkest of shade...

Your words, like shards of broken glass,
Scattered the dreams we used to hold 
But love, like a phoenix, might rise at last,
From the ashes of a story that is yet to be told.

I loved you so much that 
None was left for me
I guess this is my destiny...

Me loving you i'll never call it a mistake... a regret!!!
Cause not in this lifetime 
But in other 
I will hold us together 

<|endofpoem|>

<|startofpoem|>

The whispers of silence, they mock me all day,
A haunting refrain, where your laughter once played.
Your absence, a thief, stole the sunshine away,
Leaving shadows that linger, a heart gone astray.

The world spins and dances in colors so bright,
A cruel, vibrant contrast to my endless dark night.
But deep in the sorrow, a memory ignites,
A spark of your smile, chasing back the cold bites.

I recall your embrace, a warmth that remains,
A phantom sensation that soothes the soul's pains.
Though tears may still fall like a relentless rain,
A ghost of a giggle escapes, a bittersweet strain.

For love, like a phoenix, can rise from the ash,
Though scorched and deformed, it carries a flash.
And maybe, just maybe, when shadows depart,
A new love will bloom, with a hopeful new start.



This laugh, bittersweet, a fragile, sad sound,
A testament to my love, lost yet still to be found 
It echoes a promise, on love's sacred ground,
That joy can return, even when deeply wound.

<|endofpoem|>

<|startofpoem|>
Spring's green embrace, a cruel, familiar sight,
Where once we met, bathed in love's golden light.
Now blossoms bloom, a vibrant, mocking scene,
A joyous dance, where once our hands had been.

The whispering breeze, a melody of pain,
Recalls your touch, a love forever slain.
This season's heart, it beats a lonely drum 
No summer's warmth, in endless winter I succumb
<|endofpoem|>

<|startofpoem|>
Across the void, a whispered plea,
Two stars once close, now set at sea.
Galaxies vast, with fading light,

Where passion burned so fierce and bright.
Our tethered dance, a broken vow,
Lost in the depths, we don't know how

To mend the rift, the endless dark,
Two lonely stars, with fading spark.
Dreaming of light, but lost in the dark.....

In the quiet expanse, whispers fade,
Echoes of promises, once made.
Yet hope persists, a flickering flame,

In the cosmic dance, we're not the same.
Through the void, a path may yet appear,
Guiding lost souls, drawing near.

Though galaxies may drift apart,
Love's constellation still beats in the heart.

And i smoke
Not to look cool
But to hold on to a fragment of sanity
Each exhale carry a thought 
A burden lifting with the drifting smoke 
For a few fleating minutes I taste
Piece of a lifetime 
I hold the ciggerate gently 
As her hand in mine
Afraid to press too hard
Afraid of calling her mine
The ashes feels like forgotten days
Reminding me of freedom
Before dreams grew heavy 
Before responsibilities bound me
Yet in the small fire i still find warmth 
A fragile glow of hope 
A silent peace of mind
So yes I smoke
Not to look cool 
But to hold on to a fragment of sanity

Gham e dil sunane ko jee chahata hai
Tumhei azmane ko jee chahata hai

Suna hai jab se Boht dur ho tum
Boht dur jane ko jee chahata hai

Humein unse koi shikayat nhi hai 
Fir bhi ruth jane ko jee chahata hai

Faqt hai yuhi unki nazro ka dhoka
Ki dhoke me ane ko jee chahata hai

Dua hai vo hamse 100 bar 
ruth unhe manane ko jee chahata hai

Nazar vo na aye magar unki gali me
Yuhi ane jane ko jee chahata hai

I let ruin all my wounds
Now they don't feel as fresh
Sometimes we send each other songs before we sleep sometimes we are playing hard to get 
I guess 
Maybe that playlist is all i deserve 
But she deserves a man that doesn't have a single doubt about her
I've met a lot of delusional people all my life but never met someone like me
I promised my future to the pretty girl 
Who knows all the good songs
Go around telling all the girls i already have the one 
I promised my future to the funny girl
Who's seen it all who makes me fall over and over again like the changing color of her hair 
Who tells me about her days or as best as she can 
I've met a lot of delusional people but never met my past self 
I've met a lot of losers but never a drunked hypocrite a fucktard like me 
Pop the bubbles in the bubbles wrap  I need to know the trains never stoping on the platform
kill the delusion in me before 
i spend even more time on this song

Me ne dekha use nazar bhar ke 
Par uski nazar me me nhi tha

Isme koi kasur nhi uska 
Uski zindagi me nhi tha 

Volikha karti ha gazale ishq mohabbat ki
Par uski mohabbat me nhi tha

Vo dua me mangti Khariyat sabki
Par uski ibadat me nhi tha

Vo dhund ne ati chand ko chat par 
Use bulane wala me nhi tha

Fir roti sisak sisak kar 
Use rula ne wala me nhi tha

Kash apnati muje bhale galat samaj kar
Sahi maine me nhi tha

Tute bikhar kach ke 2 tukde gire 
Kisi aine me me nhi tha

Aaj fir dil ghabraya hai
Hawa ka jhoka fir uski yad leaya hai

Me uski awaz sune ko taras ra ha hu
Aur vo kis aur ko apni kahaniya suna aya hai
Aaj fir man nhi lag raha

Shayad use bhi mera khayal aya hai
Kya kami reh gayi thi mere pyar me
is sawal ne bar bar rulaya hai

Aaj fir need nhi arahi
Sapno me ab mana nhi pau ga use
Khair mana ke bhi kya faida

Ye ek tarfa Mohabbat me kab tak nibhauga
Aaj fir ankhe nam hai meri
Shayad use ne kisi aur ko gale laga ya hai

Meri jan ye kya halt kardi hai tune meri 
Muje mar ne se pehele bar bar jalaya hai

Aaj fir dil ghabraya hai
Ye hawa ka jhoka uski yad Aaj fir le aya hai
